"""Citation check — verify buyer-provided `sources` (FR9, Story 2.4).

The fourth slice of the verification engine `[B]`. Given the `sources` a buyer supplied
with their output, this module checks each one on two axes and flags it
`ok`/`fabricated`/`misattributed` for the PRD §6 `citations_checked[]` field:

  1. **Retrievability** — a small, injectable `httpx` GET of the source URL (status < 400,
     redirects followed, browser-like `User-Agent`). Classified **three ways** (Story 3.1):
     `retrievable`, `absent` (a DEFINITIVE 404/410), or `ambiguous` (any other 4xx/5xx or a
     transport error). Only a confirmed-`absent` source is `fabricated` — the only
     verdict-flipping citation flag (FR10 `fail = ≥1 fabricated citation`, applied by the
     Story 2.5 aggregator, not here); an `ambiguous` source (paywalled / rate-limited /
     momentarily down) is the conservative `ok`, never a false `fabricated` (NFR4).
  2. **Support** — whether the retrieved source actually backs the output. This **reuses the
     existing `proov.llm.judge_claim` seam** (Story 2.3) — NO new `LLMProvider` method, NO
     change to `proov/llm.py`; citation support is the *third* consumer of that interface
     (extract → retrieve → judge), proving the seam composes. The submitted `output` is the
     synthetic "attached claim" (the flat PRD §6 `sources` list carries no per-source claim
     linkage — see the story's Open Question 2).

Precision over recall (NFR4): `fabricated` fires ONLY on a confirmed-unretrievable source,
`misattributed` ONLY on a positive `unsupported` judgment — never on mere uncertainty ("a
verifier that cries wolf is worse than useless", PRD §1). Like `retrieve_evidence`, the
top-level `check_citations` **never raises out** (degrade, don't drop — NFR3): a bad source
degrades to a conservative non-fabricated `ok`, not a crash and not a false `fabricated`.

Quick checks **provided sources only** (architecture §4); Deep (Story 2.7) ALSO covers the
**discovered** sources the retrieval surfaced — flagged at ZERO extra network/LLM cost by
reusing the stance the judge already assigned (no re-fetch, no re-judge), passed in via the
`discovered` kwarg. No `croo` import — engine `[B]` code; `httpx` is allowed (off the SDK path).
